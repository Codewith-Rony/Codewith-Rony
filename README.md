😎 About Me
👨‍💻 Hey techies! I’m Rony Thomas, a passionate developer who loves turning real-world challenges into functional and elegant digital solutions. From responsive web apps to mobile-first Flutter projects — I enjoy building things that work, look good, and solve problems.

🚀 I’m actively exploring the world of AI/ML. I’m also enthusiastic about building scalable web applications and experimenting with new technologies.

💡 I believe in building by doing — whether it's through solo hacks or collaborative dev sprints, I’m always learning and creating.

Let’s connect and build something meaningful! 💻✨
